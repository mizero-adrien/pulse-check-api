# Pulse-Check API

A production-grade Dead Man's Switch API built for CritMon Servers Inc.
The system monitors remote IoT devices such as solar farms and weather stations.
Devices register with a countdown timer and must send periodic heartbeats to
confirm they are online. If a device fails to ping before its timer expires,
the system automatically triggers an AI-powered alert with diagnosis and
recommended action.

## Security Model

This API implements a dual authentication system designed for IoT infrastructure:

### API Key Authentication (Devices)
Devices authenticate using API keys with the format `psk_live_xxxxxxxx`.
Keys are generated by engineers and programmed into device firmware.
Each device has its own unique key for security isolation.

Header: `X-API-Key: psk_live_xxxxxxxx`

Protected endpoints: `POST /monitors/{id}/heartbeat`, `POST /monitors/{id}/pause`

### JWT Authentication (Engineers)
Human engineers authenticate using email and password to receive a JWT token.
Tokens expire after 30 minutes for security.

Header: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci...`

Protected endpoints: All GET endpoints, DELETE, API key management

### Why Not JWT for Devices
JWT requires a login system with username and password.
Remote IoT devices such as solar panels cannot interactively authenticate.
API Keys are the industry standard for machine-to-machine communication
used by Stripe, Twilio, AWS IoT, and Flutterwave.

### Rate Limiting
- `POST /monitors`: 10 requests per minute
- `POST /monitors/{id}/heartbeat`: 60 requests per minute
- `POST /monitors/{id}/pause`: 10 requests per minute

### Request ID Tracking
Every request receives a unique UUID in the `X-Request-ID` response header.
This enables precise log tracing and debugging in production environments.

## Developer's Choice Features

### 1. AI-Powered Failure Analysis
When a device times out, the system calls the Anthropic Claude API to analyze
the failure pattern and provide actionable insights.

The AI returns:
- `diagnosis`: power failure, network issue, hardware failure, or theft
- `recommended_action`: specific steps for the repair team
- `confidence`: percentage confidence in the diagnosis
- `health_score`: device health from 0 to 100

This reduces mean time to repair (MTTR) by giving engineers immediate
context instead of requiring manual investigation.

### 2. System Dashboard
The `GET /monitors/dashboard` endpoint provides a real-time system overview
including device counts by status, AI diagnosis breakdown, average health
score, and system status message. This gives operations teams an immediate
view of infrastructure health.

### 3. Per-Device API Key Generation
Instead of sharing one master key across all devices, each device receives
its own unique API key. If one device is compromised, only that device is
affected. This follows the security principle of least privilege and matches
how AWS IoT and Stripe handle device authentication.

### 4. Pagination and Filtering
All list endpoints support pagination and status filtering. This prevents
performance degradation as the number of monitored devices grows and matches
the behavior of production APIs like GitHub and Stripe.

### 5. Input Validation
All inputs are validated with strict rules. Device IDs must be alphanumeric
with hyphens only. Timeouts must be between 10 and 86400 seconds. Passwords
must contain uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters. This prevents
bad data from entering the system and improves security.

## Design Decisions

### FastAPI over Django
FastAPI was chosen for its native async support, automatic Swagger documentation,
and modern Python type hints. Django is better suited for full web applications
with admin panels. This project is a pure API service where FastAPI excels.

### PostgreSQL over In-Memory Storage
PostgreSQL ensures data persistence across server restarts. If the server
crashes and restarts, all monitors, alerts, and keys are recovered from the
database. An in-memory dictionary would lose all data on restart.

### APScheduler for Timers
APScheduler runs background jobs every second to check for timed-out monitors.
It integrates cleanly with FastAPI's async architecture and supports
exactly-once execution to prevent duplicate alerts.

### Anthropic Claude for AI Analysis
Claude API provides intelligent failure diagnosis instead of simple alert
logging. This transforms the system from a passive monitor into an active
diagnostic tool that helps engineers respond faster.

### Alembic for Migrations
Alembic manages database schema changes in a versioned and reproducible way.
This is the professional standard for production database management and
allows the team to track and roll back schema changes safely.
